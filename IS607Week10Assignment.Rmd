Choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it to an R dataframe.

The following code accesses the New York Times Book Reviews for the author Lee Child, and stores them in a dataframe in R.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

nyt_book_key <- "&api-key=15c2827997f9e1400c5cc5cd88af8111:7:73337648" ## store the api key so the API can be accessed
url <- "http://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/reviews.json?author=Lee%20Child" ## web address to access using author name 
book_review_request <- fromJSON(paste0(url, nyt_book_key))  ## make the request, submit the API key and bring info into r
lee_child_nyt_book_reviews <- book_review_request$results  ## store the results, culling extraneous info

head(lee_child_nyt_book_reviews, 2) ## View the first 2 rows of the data frame

lee_child_nyt_book_reviews[c("book_title", "summary")] ## View 2 columns of interest from the data frame

```
